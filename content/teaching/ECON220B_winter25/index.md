### General Info
__Discussion Section__: Thursday from 5:00 to 6:30 pm, SSB 107. __Office hour__: Thursday from 6:30 to 7:00 pm, SSB 107. 

### Material 
1. $\textcolor{orange}{Basics\; of\; asymptotics}$: convergence theorems, asymptotic linear representation and delta method. Evercises on ratio of two estimators and deceiving asymptotics. ([Slides](https://lapobini.github.io/discussion/ECON220B_winter25/ds1.pdf))
2. Introduction to $\textcolor{orange}{potential\; outcomes}$ and some linear regression arithmetic: orthogonal projection, coefficient of determination and Frisch–Waugh–Lovell Theorem. ([Slides](https://lapobini.github.io/discussion/ECON220B_winter25/ds2.pdf))
3. $\textcolor{orange}{Where\; is\; \hat{\beta}_{OLS}\; estimator\; converging\; to\;}$? Exogeneity vs uncorrelatedness vs linear projection. Bayesian inference and ridge regression. ([Slides](https://lapobini.github.io/discussion/ECON220B_winter25/ds3.pdf))
4. $\textcolor{orange}{Midterm\; review}$: Q1 algebraic properties of OLS; Q2 properties of empirical CDF estimator. ([Slides](https://lapobini.github.io/discussion/ECON220B_winter25/ds4_annotated.pdf))
5. $\textcolor{orange}{Selection\; on\; observables}$. Inverse probability weighting, regression adjustment estimator and an exercise on propensity score and fat-tailed distributions. ([Slides](https://lapobini.github.io/discussion/ECON220B_winter25/ds5.pdf))
6. $\textcolor{orange}{Practice \; final}$: asymptotics of moving average of order one, $$ Y_t = c + \theta_1 u_{t-1} + u_t$$, CLT for dependent data. ([Test](https://lapobini.github.io/discussion/ECON220B_winter25/MockExam.pdf))
7. $\textcolor{orange}{Instrumental\; variables \; and \; LATE}$. Comparison MoM, Wald, TSLS and control function approach, LATE in Threshold Crossing Model. ([Slides](https://lapobini.github.io/discussion/ECON220B_winter25/ds7_8.pdf))
8. $\textcolor{orange}{M-Estimation}$: general consistency theorem and uniform law of large numbers. Exercise on the estimation of a right-censored Poisson Survival model. ([Slides](https://lapobini.github.io/discussion/ECON220B_winter25/ds9.pdf))
