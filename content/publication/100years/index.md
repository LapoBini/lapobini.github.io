abstract: This study explores the business cycle regularities of the US economy since 1900, in the spirit of Burns and Mitchell (1946). Using a multivariate unobserved components model, we estimate trends and cyclical components identified via restrictions grounded in economic theory and exploiting information in survey data. The stylised facts that we uncover are open to different structural interpretations but they rule out the hypothesis that the Phillips curve was ever dead.
