## Bio

I am a PhD Student in Economics at UC San Diego. My research interests include non-stationary time-series models, causal inference in macroeconomics and the evolution of economic networks over time. I bring over three years of experience as an Economist at Now-Casting Economics Ltd, a leading professional forecasting firm. In 2023, I developed and implemented a real-time nowcasting model for the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action to predict Inflation and real GDP growth, using high-frequency and alternative data.
