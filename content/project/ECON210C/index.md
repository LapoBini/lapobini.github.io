The repository [ECON210C](https://github.com/LapoBini/210C) contains the codes for assignments and final exam for ECON210C of Prof Johannes Wieland (Spring 2024).

### HW1 - Sequence Space

The first assignment require to solve a RBC DSGE model using the Sequence Space methodology ($\textcolor{orange}{Auclert}$ $\textcolor{orange}{et}$ $\textcolor{orange}{al.,}$ $\textcolor{orange}{(2021)}$). 

$$y_t$$ 
The basic idea is to organize the model into blocks that represents different behaviors of possible heterogeneous agents and interact in GE via a small set of aggregates. Let's now denote $\mathrm{U} = \{U_1,\dots,U_t\}$

### HW2 - Structural VAR

### HW4 - Undetermine Coefficient
