## Introduction

The repository [ECON210C](https://github.com/LapoBini/210C) contains the codes for assignments and final exam for ECON210C of Prof Johannes Wieland (Spring 2024). The course covers different solution methods for DSGE model, and identification strategies for structural VAR. 

### Sequence Space

The first assignment (__ECON210C__ > __HW1__) require to solve a RBC DSGE model using the Sequence Space methodology ($\textcolor{orange}{Auclert}$ $\textcolor{orange}{et}$ $\textcolor{orange}{al.,}$ $\textcolor{orange}{(2021)}$). 

The basic idea is to organize the model into blocks that represents different behaviors of possible heterogeneous agents and interact in GE via a small set of aggregates. Let's now denote $\mathrm{U} = \{U_1,\dots,U_t\}$

$$Y_t = c + A_1 Y_{t-1}+\dots+A_p Y_{t-p} + u_t$$

### Structural VAR

### Undetermine Coefficients

### New-Keynesian Model
